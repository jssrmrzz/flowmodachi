Welcome to Flowmodachi 🎉

To install:

1. Drag Flowmodachi.app into the Applications folder.
2. Right-click the app and choose 'Open' (this bypasses macOS security warning for first-time use).
3. You're good to go!

Thanks for helping test the MVP(minimal viable product) 🙂

* Reason for the macOS security warning is I have not paid for an Apple Developer License...yet. 


💬 How to Give Feedback
I’d love to hear your thoughts! You can send feedback directly through the app:

Click the Flowmodachi icon "🫥" in your macOS menu bar.

Right-click the icon to open the menu.

Select “Settings…” from the dropdown.

In the Settings window, click the “Send Feedback” button.

This will open your default email app with a pre-filled message — just add your feedback and hit send!
